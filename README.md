# Project Documentation: AI-Powered Navigation Glasses for Impaired Individuals

## Project Overview
The AI-Powered Navigation Glasses aim to empower visually impaired individuals to navigate their surroundings more effectively. Using a combination of AI, computer vision, and real-time audio feedback, the glasses will assist users in identifying objects, understanding environments, and making informed decisions.

### Key Features:
- **Camera Integration:** Captures the user's environment in real-time.
- **AI-Powered Object Detection:** Identifies objects and their locations using advanced machine learning models.
- **Interactive Voice Assistant:** Users can interact with the system via voice commands for seamless communication.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Provides auditory descriptions and directions to guide the user.

---

## Objectives
- Enhance the independence and quality of life for visually impaired individuals.
- Leverage open-source collaboration to improve and expand the system.
- Create a cost-effective and scalable solution for global adoption.

## System Architecture

### 1. Hardware Components:
- **Smart Glasses Frame:** Lightweight and ergonomic.
- **Camera Module:** High-definition camera for real-time environment capture.
- **Microphone and Speaker:** For user input and audio feedback.
- **Processing Unit:** Embedded system or mobile device for running AI algorithms.

### 2. Software Components:
- **Object Detection Model:** Uses frameworks like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or similar.
- **Voice Interaction System:** Powered by NLP libraries such as OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Edge Computing:** Real-time processing on the device or cloud integration for heavy computations.

## Functional Workflow
1. **Input:**
   - The camera captures the surroundings.
   - User issues a voice command, e.g., "Where is the ketchup?"
2. **Processing:**
   - The AI system processes the image and voice input.
   - Identifies objects and their locations in the visual field.
3. **Output:**
   - Provides audio feedback, e.g., "The ketchup is on the leftmost part of the door."
