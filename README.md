  - Captures the user's environment in real-time
  - High-definition visual processing
  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Object Detection**
  - Identifies objects and their locations
  - Uses advanced machine learning models
  
- 🗣️ **Interactive Voice Assistant**
  - Natural language processing
  - Seamless voice command interface
  
- ⚡ **Real-Time Feedback**
  - Instant auditory descriptions
  - Precise directional guidance

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🌟 Enhance independence and quality of life for visually impaired individuals
- 🤝 Leverage open-source collaboration to improve the system
- 💡 Create a cost-effective and scalable solution for global adoption
